# Pin Code & Place Search

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for a place using a pin code or find a pin code by entering a place name. The application uses the [Postal Pincode API](https://api.postalpincode.in/) to fetch data and is designed to be mobile-friendly.

## Features
- Search for a place (post office, district, state) by entering a 6-digit Indian pin code.
- Search for a pin code by entering a place name (e.g., post office name).
- Mobile-friendly design with responsive layout.
- Input validation to ensure only numbers are entered for pin codes.
- Displays "No results found" when no data is available.
